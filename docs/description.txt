Dropdown Extractor extension allows you to copy all items from a dropdown to your clipboard.

How it works

– Click the extension icon → extractor becomes armed
– Open a dropdown on the page
– Click one of its options (not needed for native <select> dropdowns)
– All dropdown items are copied to the clipboard

The extractor automatically expires after a short timeout if no dropdown items are extracted.

What gets extracted

You can choose what to copy via options:

– Item text — what you see on screen
– Item value — the underlying value
– Both — copied using a configurable format (tab, space, dash, etc.)

Safe capture

If enabled in the options, Safe capture prevents option clicks from triggering actions while extracting. This lets you copy dropdown items without selecting an option. Safe capture does not apply to native <select> dropdowns.

Supported dropdown types (examples):

– Native <select>
– ARIA listbox (role="listbox")
– React Select
– MUI Autocomplete
– Radix menu
…and many others

We are constantly adding new supported types. If you found one that’s not yet supported, please let us know!
