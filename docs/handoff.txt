Project: dropdown-extractor (Chrome extension)

Goal of this handoff:
Give a new thread enough context (beyond code) to continue work.

Current behavior highlights:
- Arm via extension button; click a menu option to extract items.
- Safe capture blocks option clicks while armed, but does NOT block menu triggers
  (aria-expanded/aria-haspopup), so menus can open while Safe capture is on.
- Debug "Any two" mode: 1/2 captures trigger/container/uncategorized; 2/2 captures option.
  Toasts include the captured type. 1/2 payload persists when 2/2 completes.

Defaults + options:
- Safe capture default is ON for new installs. Background onInstalled sets it true if unset.
- Options page includes a "Reset to defaults" button under Safe capture.
- Safe capture label has a tooltip explaining: clicking a menu option won’t select it.

Supported dropdown types (README/test page are updated):
- Native <select>, ARIA listbox, Selectize, React Select (incl. Atlassian variant),
  Downshift-style, MUI Autocomplete-style, Radix menu, Ant Design Select,
  Select2, Chosen, GitHub SelectMenu (checkbox list), AliExpress search suggestions.
- Google search suggestions work via ARIA listbox/option.

Recent fixes/features:
- GitHub SelectMenu extraction fixed. Handler triggers only within .SelectMenu list items.
  Non-debug now extracts checkbox text/value (e.g., "Future ideas [7075802]").
- Generic listitem menu support added (containers with role="listitem") for popup menus
  lacking list/listbox/menu roles; visibility uses rect + computed style (not offsetParent),
  which fixes fixed-position popups like Quora.
- AliExpress suggestions support added (history/discover more + productlist suggestions).
  Uses href as value; value/data-value are ignored. Safe capture uses mousedown.
- Safe capture blocking logic only triggers when a visible menu container exists, and avoids
  blocking likely menu triggers.

Test page:
- Includes GitHub SelectMenu mock and AliExpress suggestions mock.
- GitHub SelectMenu test mock toggle logic avoids double toggles on checkbox/label.
- AliExpress test note: href is treated as value; value/data-value ignored.

Notes for future work:
- If adding a new dropdown type, prefer creating a test page mock + README entry.
- For debugging unsupported menus, use Debug -> Any two to capture trigger/container/option.
- Before committing, review the full diff and draft a commit message that covers all changes.

Description file:
- Source: `docs/description.txt` (short Chrome Web Store description).
- Update it when README’s supported dropdown list or key wording changes.
- Packaging: writes `dist/description-to-upload.txt` only if the description changed
  since last upload (tracked in `dist/.description-last`). The file is not removed
  automatically; delete it manually after you upload.
